# Trainingproject
The training system is the ultimate solution for digitization and facilitation of field operations and field training. From entering the student to the admission and subtraction system in an alternative project and the available sections. A program that converts routine work into digital in the field such as student group management system
Easy access. Tracks student information such as:
• Training information
• training place
• Number of hours of training
• Behavior data
• Attendance
Student evaluation
• Communicate with the supervisor in the company
The system maintains records of students, training, training records, training venues, training evaluation, number of hours, training summary in which they are registered and the results of their studies. The application is distributed because the data is stored centrally by managing a registration database that is accessed by faculty and administrators across staff. Students also access the system to view their scores. A real system will be service-oriented and will present some of its functions as a set of services.
To run the project, use the training .sql file to run the database
